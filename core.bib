   abstract = {This paper surveys the academic literature concerning the formation of pricing bubbles in digital currency markets. Studies indicate that several bubble phases have taken place in Bitcoin prices, mostly during the years 2013 and 2017. Other digital currencies of primary importance, such as Ethereum and Litecoin, also exhibit several bubble phases. The Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) as well as the Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) methodology are the most frequently employed techniques for bubble detection and measurement. Based on much academic research, Bitcoin appears to have been in a bubble-phase since June 2015, while Ethereum, NEM, Stellar, Ripple, Litecoin and Dash have been denoted as possessing bubble-like characteristics since September 2015. However, this latter group possess little academic evidence supporting the presence of bubbles since early 2018. An overall perspective is provided based on a robust bibliography based on large deviations of market quotes from fundamental values that can serve as a guide to policymakers, academics and investors.},

   abstract = {This paper suggests evolving linear models as a powerful alternative for online forecasting of synchronous time series. First, using a priori knowledge of an expert, all known possible features are clustered in some categories so that each category includes homogeneous features. Then, a novel evolving correlation-based forward subset selection technique is used to determine relevant features from each category. Next, based on the selected features, an estimation of the output of the system is modeled through an evolving adaptive linear regression model. In evolving systems, selected features and their associated weights could vary over time based on new incoming data samples which contain new information. Finally, a soft combination of output estimations of all categories, in a new sense of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system, gives the prediction of the output of the system at each sampling time. The approach offers a certain new view at the enhancement of evolving forecasting models. The proposed approach embodies recursive learning and one-step-ahead incremental algorithms that progressively modify the model to ensure continuous learning, and self-organization of the model structure and its parameters. Two real-world problems, forecasting electricity load of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas region and stock price forecasting of technology sector of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, are provided to validate the developed method. Pros and cons of the proposed approach are comprehensively discussed and shown through simulation results and comparisons with other state-of-the-art techniques.},

As the Web information grows, researchers begin to extract effective indicators (e.g., the events and sentiments) from the Web to facilitate the prediction. However, the indicators obtained in previous studies are usually based on only one data source and thus may not fully cover the factors that can affect the stock market movements. In this paper, to improve the prediction for stock market composite index movements, we exploit the consistencies among different data sources, and develop a multi-source multiple instance model that can effectively combine events, sentiments, as well as the quantitative data into a comprehensive framework. To effectively capture the news events, we successfully apply a novel event extraction and representation method. Evaluations on the data from the year 2015 and 2016 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. In addition, our approach is able to automatically determine the importance of each data source and identify the crucial input information that is considered to drive the movements, making the predictions interpretable.},

However, such signals are not trivial to model because the connections among stocks are not physically presented and need to be estimated from volatile data. Motivated by this observation, we propose a framework that incorporates the inter-connection of firms to forecast stock prices. To effectively utilize a large set of fundamental features, we further design a novel pipeline. First, we use variational autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimension of stock fundamental information and then cluster stocks into a graph structure (fundamentally clustering). Second, a hybrid model of graph convolutional network and long-short term memory network (GCN-LSTM) with an adjacency graph matrix (learnt from VAE) is proposed for graph-structured stock market forecasting. Experiments on minute-level U.S. stock market data demonstrate that our model effectively captures both spatial and temporal signals and achieves superior improvement over baseline methods. The proposed model is promising for other applications in which there is a possible but hidden spatial dependency to improve time-series prediction.},

To do so, index directions were input to a network designed to reflect some intuitive dependencies amongst continental markets, moving through 24 and 48 h cycles, and outputting iBOVESPA's next day closing direction. Two different network topologies were tested, with different numbers of stock indices used in each test. Best results were obtained with the model that accounts for a single index per continent, up to 24 h before iBOVESPA's closing time. Mean accuracy with this configuration was around 71% (with almost 78% top accuracy). With results comparable to those of the related literature, our model has the further advantage of being simpler and more tractable for its users. Also, along with the fact that it not only gives the next day closing direction, but also furnishes the set of indices that influence iBovespa the most, the model lends itself both to academic research purposes and as one of the building blocks in more robust decision support systems.},

A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short-term prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices.

Consequently, many people are beginning to become more aware and accepting of the nature of digital currencies, and traders in particular seek to know how they can make profitable crypto-coin trades and investments.

The authors then attempt to learn from past studies and construct a more holistic approach to a predictive price model for the cryptocurrency market. This focuses on assessing key factors that affect the volatility of the market - public perception, trading data, historic price data, and the interdependencies between Bitcoin and Altcoins - and how they can be best utilized from a technological aspect by applying sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques, to increase the efficiency of the process.},

More specifically, this study assesses whether crisis periods, particularly the coronavirus disease pandemic, influence the dynamic of cryptocurrency volatility. We investigate the four main cryptocurrency markets (Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic, Ethereum, and Ripple) from April 2018 to June 2020. The realized volatility measure is computed and decomposed to various components (continuous versus discontinuous, positive and negative semi-variances, and signed jumps). A variety of heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models are developed including these components, thereby enabling assessment of different assumptions (including persistence and asymmetric dynamic) of modelling and volatility forecasting based on in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting strategies, respectively. Our results reveal three main findings. First, the extended HAR model that includes the positive and negative jumps appears to be the best model for predicting future volatility for both crisis and non-crisis periods. Second, during the crisis period, only the negative jump component is statistically significant. Third, in terms of volatility forecasting, the results show that the extended HAR model that includes positive and negative semi-variances outperform the other models.},

Consequently, the volatility of the various cryptocurrency prices attracts substantial attention from both investors and researchers. It is a challenging task to forecast the prices of cryptocurrencies due to the non-stationary prices and the stochastic effects in the market. Current cryptocurrency price forecasting models mainly focus on analyzing exogenous factors, such as macro-financial indicators, blockchain information, and social media data – with the aim of improving the prediction accuracy. However, the intrinsic systemic noise, caused by market and political conditions, is complex to interpret. Inspired by the strong correlations among cryptocurrencies and the powerful modelling capability displayed by deep learning techniques, we propose a Weighted & Attentive Memory Channels model to predict the daily close price and the fluctuation of cryptocurrencies. In particular, our proposed model consists of three modules: an Attentive Memory module combines a Gated Recurrent Unit with a self-attention component to establish attentive memory for each input sequence; a Channel-wise Weighting module receives the price of several heavyweight cryptocurrencies and learns their interdependencies by recalibrating the weights for each sequence; and a Convolution & Pooling module extracts local temporal features, thereby improving the generalization ability of the overall model. In order to validate the proposed model, we conduct a battery of experiments. The results show that our proposed scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms the baseline models in prediction error, accuracy, and profitability.},

   abstract = {Cryptocurrency is playing an increasingly important role in reshaping the financial system due to its growing popular appeal and mechant acceptance. While many people are making investments in Cryptocurrency, the dynamical features, uncertainty, the predictability of Cryptocurrency are still mostly unknown, which dramatically risk the investments. It is a matter to try to understand the factors that infiuence the value formation. In this study, we use advanced artificial intelligence frameworks of fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network to analyse the price dynamics of Bitcoin, Etherum, and Ripple. We find that ANN tends to rely more on long-term history while LSTM tends to rely more on short-term dynamics, which indicate the efficiency of LSTM to utilise useful information hidden in historical memory is stronger than ANN. However, given enough historical information ANN can achieve a similar accuracy, compared with LSTM. This study provides a unique demonstration that Cryptocurrency market price is predictable. However, the explanation of the predictability could vary depending on the nature of the involved machine-learning model.},

Nine cryptocurrency factors form successful long-short strategies that generate sizable and statistically significant excess returns. We show that all of these strategies are accounted for by the cryptocurrency three-factor model.},

@article{Phillips2018,
   abstract = {Cryptocurrencies have experienced recent surges in interest and price. It has been discovered that there are time intervals where cryptocurrency prices and certain online and social media factors appear related. In addition it has been noted that cryptocurrencies are prone to experience intervals of bubble-like price growth. The hypothesis investigated here is that relationships between online factors and price are dependent on market regime. In this paper, wavelet coherence is used to study co-movement between a cryptocurrency price and its related factors, for a number of examples. This is used alongside a well-known test for financial asset bubbles to explore whether relationships change dependent on regime. The primary finding of this work is that medium-term positive correlations between online factors and price strengthen significantly during bubble-like regimes of the price series; this explains why these relationships have previously been seen to appear and disappear over time. A secondary finding is that short-term relationships between the chosen factors and price appear to be caused by particular market events (such as hacks / security breaches), and are not consistent from one time interval to another in the effect of the factor upon the price. In addition, for the first time, wavelet coherence is used to explore the relationships between different cryptocurrencies.},

   abstract = {This paper describes the construction of the short-term forecasting model of cryptocurrencies’ prices using machine learning approach. The modified model of Binary Auto Regressive Tree (BART) is adapted from the standard models of regression trees and the data of the time series. BART combines the classic algorithm classification and regression trees (C&RT) and autoregressive models ARIMA. Using the BART model, we made a short-term forecast (from 5 to 30 days) for the 3 most capitalized cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple. We found that the proposed approach was more accurate than the ARIMA-ARFIMA models in forecasting cryptocurrencies time series both in the periods of slow rising (falling) and in the periods of transition dynamics (change of trend).},

   abstract = {We implement deep learning techniques to forecast the price of the three most widely traded digital currencies i.e., Bitcoin, Digital Cash and Ripple. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to make use of deep learning in cryptocurrency prediction. The results from testing the existence of nonlinearity revealed that the time series of all digital currencies exhibit fractal dynamics, long memory and self-similarity. The predictability of long-short term memory neural network topologies (LSTM) is significantly higher when compared to the generalized regression neural architecture, set forth as our benchmark system. The latter failed to approximate global nonlinear hidden patterns regardless of the degree of contamination with noise, as they are based on Gaussian kernels suitable only for local approximation of non-stationary signals. Although the computational burden of the LSTM model is higher as opposed to brute force in nonlinear pattern recognition, eventually deep learning was found to be highly efficient in forecasting the inherent chaotic dynamics of cryptocurrency markets.},

More than 1500 cryptocurrencies are currently circulated in the market. The
technology underpinning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is Blockchain and is
a rapidly growing decentralized distributed ledger technology which find its
major involvement in cryptocurrencies. But cryptocurrencies are of extremely
volatile and fragile nature which makes it difficult to be used as a stable
currency for transactions and devoid this market of human trust. Cryptocurrency
market is controlled by various social and government factors which keeps it
fluctuating. This paper identifies and discusses the important factors that
