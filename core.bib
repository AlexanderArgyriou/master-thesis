   abstract = {Cryptocurrencies have experienced recent surges in interest and price. It has been discovered that there are time intervals where cryptocurrency prices and certain online and social media factors appear related. In addition it has been noted that cryptocurrencies are prone to experience intervals of bubble-like price growth. The hypothesis investigated here is that relationships between online factors and price are dependent on market regime. In this paper, wavelet coherence is used to study co-movement between a cryptocurrency price and its related factors, for a number of examples. This is used alongside a well-known test for financial asset bubbles to explore whether relationships change dependent on regime. The primary finding of this work is that medium-term positive correlations between online factors and price strengthen significantly during bubble-like regimes of the price series; this explains why these relationships have previously been seen to appear and disappear over time. A secondary finding is that short-term relationships between the chosen factors and price appear to be caused by particular market events (such as hacks / security breaches), and are not consistent from one time interval to another in the effect of the factor upon the price. In addition, for the first time, wavelet coherence is used to explore the relationships between different cryptocurrencies.},

   abstract = {The realm of cryptocurrency has grown exponentially over the past decade, with the most rapid advances seen in the past few years as more and more parties around the world recognize the value of holding digital assets online. Statistics from Twitter support this statement where, approximately 1,500 Tweets about Bitcoin alone is recorded per hour. Consequently, many people are beginning to become more aware and accepting of the nature of digital currencies, and traders in particular seek to know how they can make profitable crypto-coin trades and investments. Although a number of research projects have been undertaken to develop systems that can effectively predict price movements in the cryptocurrency market, they display significant efficiency gaps, which this paper further explores. The authors then attempt to learn from past studies and construct a more holistic approach to a predictive price model for the cryptocurrency market. This focuses on assessing key factors that affect the volatility of the market - public perception, trading data, historic price data, and the interdependencies between Bitcoin and Altcoins - and how they can be best utilized from a technological aspect by applying sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques, to increase the efficiency of the process.},

   abstract = {In this work, we investigate the feasibility of Bayesian Networks as a way to verify the extent to which stock market indices from around the globe influence iBOVESPA – the main index at the São Paulo Stock Exchange, Brazil. To do so, index directions were input to a network designed to reflect some intuitive dependencies amongst continental markets, moving through 24 and 48 h cycles, and outputting iBOVESPA's next day closing direction. Two different network topologies were tested, with different numbers of stock indices used in each test. Best results were obtained with the model that accounts for a single index per continent, up to 24 h before iBOVESPA's closing time. Mean accuracy with this configuration was around 71% (with almost 78% top accuracy). With results comparable to those of the related literature, our model has the further advantage of being simpler and more tractable for its users. Also, along with the fact that it not only gives the next day closing direction, but also furnishes the set of indices that influence iBovespa the most, the model lends itself both to academic research purposes and as one of the building blocks in more robust decision support systems.},

   abstract = {Forecasting the stock market movements is an important and challenging task. As the Web information grows, researchers begin to extract effective indicators (e.g., the events and sentiments) from the Web to facilitate the prediction. However, the indicators obtained in previous studies are usually based on only one data source and thus may not fully cover the factors that can affect the stock market movements. In this paper, to improve the prediction for stock market composite index movements, we exploit the consistencies among different data sources, and develop a multi-source multiple instance model that can effectively combine events, sentiments, as well as the quantitative data into a comprehensive framework. To effectively capture the news events, we successfully apply a novel event extraction and representation method. Evaluations on the data from the year 2015 and 2016 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. In addition, our approach is able to automatically determine the importance of each data source and identify the crucial input information that is considered to drive the movements, making the predictions interpretable.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to make use of deep learning in cryptocurrency prediction. The results from testing the existence of nonlinearity revealed that the time series of all digital currencies exhibit fractal dynamics, long memory and self-similarity. The predictability of long-short term memory neural network topologies (LSTM) is significantly higher when compared to the generalized regression neural architecture, set forth as our benchmark system. The latter failed to approximate global nonlinear hidden patterns regardless of the degree of contamination with noise, as they are based on Gaussian kernels suitable only for local approximation of non-stationary signals. Although the computational burden of the LSTM model is higher as opposed to brute force in nonlinear pattern recognition, eventually deep learning was found to be highly efficient in forecasting the inherent chaotic dynamics of cryptocurrency markets.},

In this study, we use advanced artificial intelligence frameworks of fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network to analyse the price dynamics of Bitcoin, Etherum, and Ripple. We find that ANN tends to rely more on long-term history while LSTM tends to rely more on short-term dynamics, which indicate the efficiency of LSTM to utilise useful information hidden in historical memory is stronger than ANN. However, given enough historical information ANN can achieve a similar accuracy, compared with LSTM. This study provides a unique demonstration that Cryptocurrency market price is predictable.

One of the main problems with decentralized cryptocurrencies is price volatility, which indicates the need for studying the underlying price model. Moreover, Bitcoin prices exhibit non-stationary behavior, where the statistical distribution of data changes over time. This paper demonstrates high-performance machine learning-based classification and regression models for predicting Bitcoin price movements and prices in short and medium terms. In previous works, machine learning-based classification has been studied for an only one-day time frame, while this work goes beyond that by using machine learning-based models for one, seven, thirty and ninety days. The developed models are feasible and have high performance, with the classification models scoring up to 65% accuracy for next-day forecast and scoring from 62 to 64% accuracy for seventh–ninetieth-day forecast. For daily price forecast, the error percentage is as low as 1.44%, while it varies from 2.88 to 4.10% for horizons of seven to ninety days. These results indicate that the presented models outperform the existing models in the literature.},

Bitcoin is currently one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capital market share. Therefore, this study proposes that sentiment analysis can be used as a computational tool to predict the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for different time intervals. A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short-term prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices. Our results prove that people's psychological and behavioural attitudes have a significant impact on the highly speculative cryptocurrency prices.},

   abstract = {Environmental decision support systems (EDSSs), or DSS applied in the environmental field, have been developed for over 40 years now. However, most of these tools fail to find use or fall out of use extremely quickly. In the aim of aiding in the conception and development of practical and successful decision support systems, i.e. systems that can lead to positive outcomes, this review looks over the existing literature, both EDSS-centric and from broader decision-related fields, to highlight some of the most important challenges influencing the success and usability of these systems. In all, 13 major challenges facing EDSS development were identified and over 60 recommendations and best practices were provided to address these challenges. Though this paper is mainly focused on environmental decision support systems, most of the highlighted information and conclusions are applicable to the development of decision support systems in any field.},

   abstract = {Stock price forecasting is an important issue and interesting topic in financial markets. Because reasonable and accurate forecasts have the potential to generate high economic benefits, many researchers have been involved in the study of stock price forecasts. In this paper, the DWT-ARIMA-GSXGB hybrid model is proposed. Firstly, the discrete wavelet transform is used to split the data set into approximation and error parts. Then the ARIMA (0, 1, 1), ARIMA (1, 1, 0), ARIMA (2, 1, 1) and ARIMA (3, 1, 0) models respectively process approximate partial data and the improved xgboost model (GSXGB) handles error partial data. Finally, the prediction results are combined using wavelet reconstruction. According to the experimental comparison of 10 stock data sets, it is found that the errors of DWT-ARIMA-GSXGB model are less than the four prediction models of ARIMA, XGBoost, GSXGB and DWT-ARI-MA-XGBoost. The simulation results show that the DWT-ARIMA-GSXGB stock price prediction model has good approximation ability and generalization ability, and can fit the stock index opening price well. And the proposed model is considered to greatly improve the predictive performance of a single ARIMA model or a single XGBoost model in predicting stock prices.},

   abstract = {This paper suggests evolving linear models as a powerful alternative for online forecasting of synchronous time series. First, using a priori knowledge of an expert, all known possible features are clustered in some categories so that each category includes homogeneous features. Then, a novel evolving correlation-based forward subset selection technique is used to determine relevant features from each category. Next, based on the selected features, an estimation of the output of the system is modeled through an evolving adaptive linear regression model. In evolving systems, selected features and their associated weights could vary over time based on new incoming data samples which contain new information. Finally, a soft combination of output estimations of all categories, in a new sense of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system, gives the prediction of the output of the system at each sampling time. The approach offers a certain new view at the enhancement of evolving forecasting models. The proposed approach embodies recursive learning and one-step-ahead incremental algorithms that progressively modify the model to ensure continuous learning, and self-organization of the model structure and its parameters. Two real-world problems, forecasting electricity load of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas region and stock price forecasting of technology sector of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, are provided to validate the developed method. Pros and cons of the proposed approach are comprehensively discussed and shown through simulation results and comparisons with other state-of-the-art techniques.},

   abstract = {After the invention of Bitcoin as well as other blockchain-based peer-to-peer payment systems, the cryptocurrency market has rapidly gained popularity. Consequently, the volatility of the various cryptocurrency prices attracts substantial attention from both investors and researchers. It is a challenging task to forecast the prices of cryptocurrencies due to the non-stationary prices and the stochastic effects in the market. Current cryptocurrency price forecasting models mainly focus on analyzing exogenous factors, such as macro-financial indicators, blockchain information, and social media data – with the aim of improving the prediction accuracy. However, the intrinsic systemic noise, caused by market and political conditions, is complex to interpret. Inspired by the strong correlations among cryptocurrencies and the powerful modelling capability displayed by deep learning techniques, we propose a Weighted & Attentive Memory Channels model to predict the daily close price and the fluctuation of cryptocurrencies. In particular, our proposed model consists of three modules: an Attentive Memory module combines a Gated Recurrent Unit with a self-attention component to establish attentive memory for each input sequence; a Channel-wise Weighting module receives the price of several heavyweight cryptocurrencies and learns their interdependencies by recalibrating the weights for each sequence; and a Convolution & Pooling module extracts local temporal features, thereby improving the generalization ability of the overall model. In order to validate the proposed model, we conduct a battery of experiments. The results show that our proposed scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms the baseline models in prediction error, accuracy, and profitability.},

   abstract = {This study aims to examine the issue of cryptocurrency volatility modelling and forecasting based on high-frequency data. More specifically, this study assesses whether crisis periods, particularly the coronavirus disease pandemic, influence the dynamic of cryptocurrency volatility. We investigate the four main cryptocurrency markets (Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic, Ethereum, and Ripple) from April 2018 to June 2020. The realized volatility measure is computed and decomposed to various components (continuous versus discontinuous, positive and negative semi-variances, and signed jumps). A variety of heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models are developed including these components, thereby enabling assessment of different assumptions (including persistence and asymmetric dynamic) of modelling and volatility forecasting based on in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting strategies, respectively. Our results reveal three main findings. First, the extended HAR model that includes the positive and negative jumps appears to be the best model for predicting future volatility for both crisis and non-crisis periods. Second, during the crisis period, only the negative jump component is statistically significant. Third, in terms of volatility forecasting, the results show that the extended HAR model that includes positive and negative semi-variances outperform the other models.},

@article{Hou2021,
   abstract = {Stocks that are fundamentally connected with each other tend to move together. Considering such common trends is believed to benefit stock movement forecasting tasks. However, such signals are not trivial to model because the connections among stocks are not physically presented and need to be estimated from volatile data. Motivated by this observation, we propose a framework that incorporates the inter-connection of firms to forecast stock prices. To effectively utilize a large set of fundamental features, we further design a novel pipeline. First, we use variational autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimension of stock fundamental information and then cluster stocks into a graph structure (fundamentally clustering). Second, a hybrid model of graph convolutional network and long-short term memory network (GCN-LSTM) with an adjacency graph matrix (learnt from VAE) is proposed for graph-structured stock market forecasting. Experiments on minute-level U.S. stock market data demonstrate that our model effectively captures both spatial and temporal signals and achieves superior improvement over baseline methods. The proposed model is promising for other applications in which there is a possible but hidden spatial dependency to improve time-series prediction.},
